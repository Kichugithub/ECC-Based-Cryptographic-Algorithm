# ECC Cryptography using Verilog

## 🔐 Project Overview

This project implements core Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) operations — Point Addition, Point Doubling, and Scalar Multiplication — using Verilog. It is targeted on the Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC FPGA (ZCU104 Evaluation Kit).

## 📚 Features

- Modular ECC operations:
  - Point Addition
  - Point Doubling
  - Scalar Multiplication
- Optimized for performance and area
- Vivado + Verilog-based design flow

## ⚙️ Tools & Tech Stack

- Verilog HDL
- Vivado Design Suite
- ECC over Curve25519 (Montgomery Form)

## 🧠 Folder Structure

- `verilog/` – Contains Verilog modules and testbenches
- `fpga/` – Vivado project files and board setup instructions
- `docs/` – Project report and diagrams

## Future Scope
- FPGA deployment on Zynq MPSoC
