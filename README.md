# ECC Cryptography using Python and Verilog

## üîê Project Overview

This project implements core Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) operations ‚Äî Point Addition, Point Doubling, and Scalar Multiplication ‚Äî using Verilog. It is targeted on the Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC FPGA (ZCU104 Evaluation Kit).

##  Features

- Modular ECC operations:
  - Point Addition
  - Point Doubling
  - Scalar Multiplication
- Optimized for performance and area
- Vivado + Verilog-based design flow

Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) is a key-based technique for encrypting data.
Public Key: A key that‚Äôs openly shared to encrypt data.

Private Key: A secret key used to decrypt data encrypted with the public key.

Shared Secret Key: A key known only to two parties, used to encrypt and decrypt messages securely.


## Novelty
Focus on ECC architecture tailored for IoT using the Montgomery curve. 
-Innovative approach combining security and efficiency for IoT.
-Prioritizes low delay and high-speed communication.
-Unique solution for secure, real-time processing in smart devices.


##  Tools & Tech Stack

- Verilog HDL
- Vivado Design Suite
- ECC over Curve25519 (Montgomery Form)
  

## Future Scope
- FPGA deployment on Zynq MPSoC
